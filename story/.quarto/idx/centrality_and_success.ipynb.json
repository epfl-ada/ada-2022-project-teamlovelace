Are they linked?","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nWe want to use wikipedia pageviews as a proxy for popularity, and try to find a correlation the centrality of actors in the actor graph. For this we used the [dataset of pageviews](https://github.com/epfl-ada/2022/blob/main/Homework/02%20-%20Regression%20Observational%20Studies%20Stats%20and%20Supervised%20Learning/data/all_entities.csv.gz) from Homework 2. Since Wikipedia was founded at the start of the century, pageviews might not be relevant for older actors. To eliminate this possible bias we only considered only actors having played in recent movies and formed the actor-graph only based on the recent movies.\n\nWe therefore consider 49481 actors accross 41039 movies, 4631 of which (the actors) we have the pageview count.\n\n\n## Computing centrality\n\nWe focused on three metrics of centrality:\n- Degree centrality: With how many other actors have the actors played\n- Eigenvector centrality\n- Betweenness: how much an actor bridges communities of actors\n\n### Who are the most central actors\n\nFor those interested, we list here the most central actors.\n\n## Comparing centrality to pageviews\n\n### Na√Øve visualisation\n\nWe first try to visualise the two values together.\n\nThe correlations we found were very modest with R^2 values of 0.016, 0.013, and 0.007 respectively\n\n### The impact of movie count\n\nHere the values are better correlated, with R^2 values of 0.479, 0.263, and 0.212 respectively.\nMovie count having a significant correlation with pageviews as well as with centrality, it acts as a confounder. We therefore aim to isolate the effects of centrality from those of movie count by using A/B testing\n\n### The A/B tests\n\nThe A/B test is done by making pairs of actors with similar numbers of movies (Here similar means that their number of movies are less than 5% different) such that the first actor has a lower centrality than the second.\n\nIn the end we find very little increases in pageviews when varying the centrality of actors. There is even a slight decrease concerning the degree centrality, although it is not statistically significant. The largest increase is with the eigenvalue centrality, with an average increase of 4.73% in pageviews per 2x increase in centrality, but with an R^2 value of 0.007. We conclude that if there is a relationship between the centrality of actors and their popularity, it is barely noticeable and not interesting.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"centrality_and_success.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
