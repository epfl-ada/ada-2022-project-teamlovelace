In other words, does \"similar\" actors are more likely connected into the same movie. We need therefore a definition of the similarity. According to several papers, one main tool to assess the similarity is called the homophily. It is the tendency for people to be attracted to those who seems similar to themselves. \n\nKnowing that we are working on a dataset of actor who are linked between each other through movies, we decided to consider only actors with a minimum degree of fifteen (which is quiet representative to movies in general as the movie story is based on interaction between a quiet large number of characters). Moreover, we also took our decision because low degree vertices shall add some unmeaningful values, particularly for categorical attribute (which can even become binary for very low link degree).\n\nFirst of all, as we will based our study on the attributes, we need to begin our analysis by quantify each attributes among the different actors of the dataset.\n\n- For the actor nationality, we have the following interactive plot. We observe a majority (around 45%) of american actors, followed by some country like Canada, India, Great britain, ... We need to keep this distribution in mind for the rest of our study, especially for the comparison part.\n\n- Furthermore, we have the four other parameters with their associated distribution according to the dataset :\n\nSome of these distributions are likely to be gaussian (height) or even a power low distribution for the number of movies played. We can mention that the gender attribute is unbalanced in our dataset and need to be also taken with caution for further interpretations.\n\nWe will now pay attention to quantify the homophily score of each actor :\n- For categorical attribute, it can be describe as follow : $$Homophily_{i} = \\frac{\\sum \\limits _j \\delta_{ij}}{k_i} $$  with $ \\delta_{ij} $ = 1 if same attribute, else -1 and $ k_i $ the degree of the node i\n\n\n- For scalar attribute, we can create a linear equation, meaning that the further the values are apart, the lower the value will be. We illustrated this defintion through the following plot :\n\nThe value for which we consider the homophily score to -1 depends on the standard deviation of the distribution (we target to aim the 95% threshold). $$ \\Delta_{max} = 2 \\times \\sigma $$\n\n- We then compute these homophily scores for each actors in order to vizualise the distribution. We end up with the following distributions according to the different attributes. The four first distributions are the categorical attributes especially with the distribution if the take only the homophily score of men actors (gender men) compared to the case where we take only the homophily score of women actress (gender women). The three next distributions are dedicated to the scalar attributes :\n\n> check value for male actor and female actress indenpendantly\n\n## Comparison with \"mean actor\" of the dataset\n\n\n\n## Randomization for comparison\n\n### NETWORX AND IGRAPH \n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"homophily.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
