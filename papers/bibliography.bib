	title = {Measuring preferential attachment in evolving networks},
	journal = {Europhysics Letters},
	abstract = {A key ingredient of many current models proposed to capture the topological evolution of complex networks is the hypothesis that highly connected nodes increase their connectivity faster than their less connected peers, a phenomenon called preferential attachment. Measurements on four networks, namely the science citation network, Internet, actor collaboration and science coauthorship network indicate that the rate at which nodes acquire links depends on the node's degree, offering direct quantitative support for the presence of preferential attachment. We find that for the first two systems the attachment rate depends linearly on the node degree, while for the last two the dependence follows a sublinear power law.}

	abstract = {Abstract Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers λ0, λ1… which sum to 1, we consider random graphs having approximately λi n vertices of degree i. Essentially, we show that if Σ i(i - 2)λi > 0, then such graphs almost surely have a giant component, while if Σ i(i -2)λ. < 0, then almost surely all components in such graphs are small. We can apply these results to Gn,p,Gn.M, and other well-known models of random graphs. There are also applications related to the chromatic number of sparse random graphs.},
