**Connectedness of the world of movies**

How connected is the world of acting ? Intuitively, we would expect "similar" movies to hire "similar" actors, meaning we'd observe clusters around certain "types" of movies. In real life social groups, we observe the six degrees of separation rule (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) : is the structure of the world of cinematography similar ? How do we construct such a connected graph : based on shared movie sets, typical personas played or movie genre ? Could we learn an embedding based on more recent methods (the paper is dated 2013), and construct a graph depending on the pairwise distance in this embedding space ? How does the graph change as we change the rules of connectivity, do clusters appear, do "distances" between two given actors change ?

**Build your own movie**

Can we learn the connection between the a movie summary and the actors that play in it ? I want to build a model which, given a summary and a movie genre, uses the same approach as the paper to embed a user-submitted summary, then is able to output a recommended list of actors for casting. The pipeline would be embedding the user summary, then generating a list Latent Topics (see tab. 3 of the paper) and Personas. Then we reverse-engineer to create a recommended list of actors (how many actors ? does this depend on the genre ?), or their specificities (i.e. an actor which is experienced in this genre, or acting out personas, etc.). We need to control for bias on age, gender etc. that might be present in the dataset. Can we predict if the movie will perform well, e.g. give an estimated revenue ?

**Cultural differences in movie tastes**

How has globalization affected taste in movies in the world ? The dataset offers a rich diversity of movies produced in different countries, and maybe the difference in "movie tastes" (is the frequency of movie genre in a country a good indicator of this ?) can give insights into the local culture ? The "ethnicity freebase id" could be interesting for this, however the original freebase dataset would have to be downloaded from https://developers.google.com/freebase. How has globalization affected this taste, can we see bimodal distributions appear, where there is some effect of globalization and Western-centric movies, but there still remains some cultural uniqueness ? One big problem I can see for this however, is that this dataset is largely biased towards western countries, especially the US and the UK or european countries. Smaller (poorer ? match with dataset from week 1 ?) countries are under-represented, and there are some interesting historical artefacts, like the presence of movies produced in the GDR (322 movies !).
